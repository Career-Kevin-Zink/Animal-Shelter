# Animal-Shelter-Project
- **The project is an Animal Shelter management software.**
- **The five contributing authors below made this as a team throughout the semester.**
- **This project was started Fall of 2019, we are all in our junior year of the software engineering program at Florida Gulf Coast University.**
- **This is a team project for CEN 3031 - Software Engineering Fundamentals.**

## Demonstration
 **Coming soon ... We will either upload a gif or video of the program in use when it is closer to being completed.**

## History
*A local animalshelter needs an application to manage their pet actions & tasks. The application will allow for workers to check-in new animals as well as adopt them out, edit the animal information, schedule events such as cleanings or vet check-ups, and search for animals by collar ID or species. It should also track the time the animals have been in the shelter. Animals’information should include the main species & sub-species.*

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
*Learn software engineering principles, concepts, methods, and techniques;
 Be able to work in a group environment to perform activities and provide documentation related to
all phases of software development, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, and testing;
Be able to construct UML diagrams (e.g. Use Case Diagram, Sequence Diagram);
Conduct an oral presentation and demonstration of a software project developed by a group.
Creating GUI with object oriented design.*
